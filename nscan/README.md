Welcome to my port scanner
With the power of multithreading, you can scan many, many ports at once!
Be careful though because if you scan too quickly, you might bring down a host or cause a ton of alerts!
As with all tools, this tool is only for use in legal and ethical activities
Run this tool by running main.py:

python main.py <host> -f

xmas scan and syn scan have not been implemented, but they would have -x and -s
